This is one of the popular CNN architecture which uses convolutional and identity blocks. This CNN consists of four convolutional blocks and 12 identity blocks. Each identity block consists of three convolutional layers including a bypass. The convolutional block consists of three convolutional layers with with convolutional layer in the bypass. Residual Convolutional nets accuracy always increases as the number of epochs increase which is not the case of other neural networks. These are computationally less expensive as compared to other CNN architecture having same number of layers.

The model identifies the signs made by fingers. The training and test data is provided in the form of .h5 format.
More than 90% accuracy is achieved in the training set and test set after tuning various hyper-parameters.
